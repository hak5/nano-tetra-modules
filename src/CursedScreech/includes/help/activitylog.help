This log contains the output of Kuro.  It will inform you when a connection is initiated, when 
a connection has been established with a target, the set TLS level with the target, when a command 
has been sent to a target, when data is received from a target, and when targets are disconnected.
<br /><br />
Sometimes, Sein will interject and add a message to the log.  This only occurs when a target has 
received a connection request from an attacker holding a key different from Kuro's.  A message is 
sent to the multicast group, Sein receives it, and posts it in the activity log.  This informs you 
that someone other than yourself is trying to access the shell on your target.
