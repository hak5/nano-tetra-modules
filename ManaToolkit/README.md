# Mana Toolkit - Module for the WiFi Pineapples  
## RC / Master-branch
This is an early release of the Mana Toolkit "Module" for the WiFi Pineapples made by me. @adde88  
It does work, on both Pineapple NANO and TETRA.  But i do not feel that it's ready yet to be submitted to the Hak5 repositories.  
I would be very happy if people have suggestions or general feedback for improving the Module.  
There's also a dev. branch on this repository for those interested in a bleeding-edge version.  

### Installation:
#### TETRA:  
* Create a folder: /pineapple/modules/ManaToolkit  
* Copy all these files to that folder.  
* Done.  
  
#### NANO:  
* Create a folder: /sd/modules/ManaToolkit  
* Copy all these files to that folder.  
* You then need to sym-link that folder: ln -s /sd/modules/ManaToolkit /pineapple/modules/ManaToolkit  
* Done.
